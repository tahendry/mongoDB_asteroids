## Asteroids Flybys

**Author**: Reto Hendry

**Course**: NoSQL Lab with Python & MongoDB (@ HSLU W, Applied Information and Data Science)

**API-Key**: Generate your own API-Key on https://api.nasa.gov/

The used API in this small project work in the noSQL course provides information about asteroids which have a close approach to our planet - the Earth.

Since I have a big telescope (Dobson: 1.2 meter length, 0.2m diameter) in my vacation-flat in the mountains this API is perfect to figure out when I should take it out during the next years to see my first asteroid through my telescope.

With that said, the goal is to discover the asteroid dataset, find interesting fact about them and determine the night I should "asteroid"-gaze.
